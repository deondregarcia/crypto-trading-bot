# first strategy:
# combination of SMA or MACD, RSI, Bollinger Bands
# for bollinger bands, add an immediate sell condition if price drops below

# Double Bollinger Band Signal Notes
#   - use standard deviation of either 0.5 and 3 or 1 and 2
#   - between 1 and 2 is buy signal, between -1 and -2 is sell signal, between 1 and -1 is neutral zone


# NOTES:
#   - All functions return nothing if there is no signal
