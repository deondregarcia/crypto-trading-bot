# for this time, both Trading View and BinanceUS reported a 1.08/0.66 and 1.09/0.67 MACD/Signal Line and closes of 1934.61 (12:46 PM)
# However, when I currently run my MACD func on it, I get 1.177/0.856 MACD/Signal Line calculations
# Possible Sources of Error:
#   1. Their close is different than what I've gathered, by 30 cents, meaning my preceding close values are most likely different as well, leading to errors in final calculations

# ---- Related to above eth_array_2 ----
# Output from my MACD calculations:
# macd_array: [1.1172527264654946, 1.0345092759448562, 0.944396591448367, 0.8706251782700747, 0.6874387537657185, 0.47722715370719015, 0.4351428619424951, 0.3638986515522902, 0.15669024263206666]
# ['macd: 1.1172527264654946', 'signal line: 0.6763534928587281']

# ---- Analysis ----
#   - my 'latest' macd is off and above target by about 0.03 - 0.04 if rounded, while my signal line appears to be off and above by 0.01 if rounded
#   - following my macd_array, the margin of error remains around 0.03 - 0.04 for 5 more inputs, and only slowly increases to 0.05, then 0.06 when compared to Trading Views and BinanceUS' values (read off charts, not documented here)

#   - OVERALL CONCLUSION: Most of the error for my calculations for the above eth_array (pulled from BinanceUS API, a different source than TradingView/BinanceUS Charts)
#   seem to be sourced from inaccurate closing inputs, so not my calculations but the BinanceUS API itself.
#   - Either the BinanceUS API is inaccurate by design for logistical reasons on their end, or I am pulling/reading the data incorrectly (but then again I am using the timestamp of the latest value)
